// Fibonacci Finder
// Create a fibFinder() function that finds the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. As a reminder, the Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical sequence that begins with 0 and 1, with each following term being the sum of the two previous terms.

// For example, the first two terms of the sequence are represented by fibFinder(0) and fibFinder(1), which return 0 and 1, respectively. fibFinder(6) should return 8.
